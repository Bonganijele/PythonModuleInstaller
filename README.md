Python Module Installer is a user-friendly tool designed to simplify the package installation process for developers, especially beginners.

 Multiple Icon Support: The app includes multiple PNG icons to enhance the user experience and visual appeal.
 System Services Support: Easily manage system services and environment creation with virtualenv and Conda.

 DPKG Integration: Supports Debian package management for installing packages via dpkg.
 Taskbar and Window Icon: The app displays a custom icon in the taskbar and window, giving it a personalized look and feel.
